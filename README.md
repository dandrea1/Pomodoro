The Pomodoro Technique is a popular time-management method invented by Italian Francesco Cirillo. 

Pick one project or task you want to focus on.
Set a timer for 25-30 minutes, and get to work.
When the buzzer sounds, take a two-to-three-minute break.
Repeat.
After four sessions, take a longer break.
Record each session with a tick or X in your notebook.
